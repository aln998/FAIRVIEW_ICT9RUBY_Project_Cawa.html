In order for combustion to happen, the fuel must be heated to its ignition temperature. With enough heat, oxygen, and fuel, the fire will keep going.

This is because leaving them overnight might cause overheating, and could result in the ignition of a fire. It is also recommended as they use a lot of power from the outlets, so unplugging them can simultaneously reduce the risk of fire, but also reduce electricity bills. </td>

    		<td align="center" class="col-md-8" style="background: #BFDB38"> Make sure to regularly clean your appliances, especially those related with cooking. Cleaning them is important in order to prevent grease from building up. Grease fires may happen, which come from hot cooking oil. Dust may also spread if appliances are not clean, which is another cause of fire ignition.</td>
